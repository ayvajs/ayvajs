## What is a Classic Stroke?

So named for its timelessness. The OG stroke. It commands Ayva to perform a simple up and down movement on the stroke axis with some 
(optional) variation on a few parameters such as speed, positions, shape, and twist. Its been often stated that many people are satisfied 
with just the stroke and twist axis. If you're one of those people, __ClassicStroke__ has got you covered!
